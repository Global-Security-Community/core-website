  - name: "George Coldham"
  bio: "Cloud Security Architect at Microsoft by day, community builder by night. I spend my time helping organisations make sense of identity, Zero Trust and AI security — without the buzzwords. Founder of the Global Security Community and occasional conference speaker. Big believer that good security is practical, human, and shared. Based in Perth, usually found connecting people, ideas, and the occasional stubborn firewall."

  - name: "Anthony Porter"
  bio: "Cloud Security Architect and Defender XDR whisperer who keeps Microsoft Intune in line and security teams smiling. Anto’s the kind of guy who simplifies complexity (KISS advocate for life) and shares practical tech wisdom without the fluff. Perth-based, community stalwart at meetups, and always up for talking automation, copilot, or Subaru mods. Just don’t ask him to stop learning certifications — he won’t."
