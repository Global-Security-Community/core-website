The Chapters page lists all active GSC chapters around the world.

## URL

`/chapters/`

## Features

- **Chapter listing** — Displays all approved chapters with their city and country
- **Chapter detail pages** — Each chapter has a dedicated page at `/chapters/{city-slug}/` showing:
  - Chapter leads with profile photos (via Gravatar)
  - Upcoming events hosted by the chapter
  - Link to the chapter's Discord channel
- **Apply to lead** — Call-to-action for community members to apply to start a new chapter

## How New Chapters Are Created

Chapters are created through the [Chapter Lead Application](chapter-application.md) process. When an application is approved, a chapter page is automatically generated and added to the chapters listing.
