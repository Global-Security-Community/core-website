# My Tickets

The My Tickets page shows all event registrations for the logged-in user.

## URL

`/my-tickets/`

## Access

Requires login. Unauthenticated users are redirected to the login page.

## Features

- **Ticket list** — Displays all events the user has registered for
- **QR codes** — Each ticket shows its unique QR code for event-day check-in
- **Check-in status** — Indicates whether the ticket has been scanned at the event
- **Event details** — Shows the event name, date, and ticket code

## How to Use

1. Log in to the GSC website
2. Click your name in the navigation bar to go to My Tickets
3. On event day, open this page on your phone and present the QR code at the scanner

> **Tip:** The website works offline as a PWA (Progressive Web App). Add it to your home screen before the event so you can access your ticket even without internet.
